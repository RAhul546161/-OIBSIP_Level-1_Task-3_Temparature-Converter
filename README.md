## 👋 Description about the Project

- The Temperature Converter project that I built using HTML, CSS, JS, and Visual Studio Code is a web-based application that allows users to convert temperatures from Celsius to Fahrenheit, Kelvin and vice versa.

- The application has a simple and intuitive user interface that allows users to enter a temperature value and select the unit of measurement they wish to convert. Once the user enters the temperature value and selects the unit of measurement, the application converts the temperature to the desired unit of measurement in real-time and displays the converted value on the screen.

- The interface is designed using CSS, making it visually appealing and user-friendly. The project uses JavaScript to implement the temperature conversion functionality, which involves calculating the temperature value based on the selected unit of measurement.
